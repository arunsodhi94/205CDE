			<p>"I won't be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season," the midfielder said.
"We will have to wait and see if that's at Liverpool or somewhere else. That's Liverpool's decision."
The former England captain, who announced his retirement from international football in July, has made almost 700 appearances for the Anfield club, playing with prolific strikers Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen.</p>
